                <h1 class="top-list">Top 10 tips for picking a resume template</h1>
                <ol>
                    <li> <p>Understand the standards of your industry</p> </li>
                    <li> <p>Familiarize yourself with the tone of your company</p> </li>
                    <li> <p>Decide on the self-image you want to present</p> </li>
                    <li> <p> Reflect on which sections are most important for your career</p></li>
                    <li> <p>Think about where you’ll need to add the most writing</p> </li>
                    <li> <p>Evaluate the presentation and attractiveness of the template</p> </li>
                    <li> <p>Pay attention to whether icons and color are appropriate for your industry</p> </li>
                    <li> <p>Check if you’ll have space for a photo or logo if it’s needed</p> </li>
                    <li> <p>Assess the most eye-catching section and make sure it matches your needs</p> </li>
                    <li> <p> Choose the resume that captures your personal style and feels right for you!</p></li>
                </ol>
                <p>If there was one template that worked for everyone – well, our website would be much, much smaller. But the truth is, a variety of <a href="#">templates</a> are important to help capture the uniqueness of each candidate. And as beautiful as each template might be, a hiring manager doesn’t want to see the same one 100 times in a row. At the end of the day, the choice comes down to you. It’s important to evaluate the level of professionalism in your industry and at the company you’re applying to and decide if a modern, stylish resume or a more traditional one would be in line with those standards. </p>
                <p>Beyond that, it’s about highlighting the experiences and abilities that make you unique. In some industries, a pop of color or a friendly photo can do the trick. In others, you’ll have to rely on your expert writing to sell yourself as a top candidate </p>

                </div>
                <p>Let’s say you pick a template but find out the skills section just doesn’t have enough space for all your talents. The best part about using our online resume builder tool is that you can switch between templates with ease. So go on, pick a template and test it out. Changing your mind is never a problem.</p>
                <h1 class="top-list">What makes the best resume template layout</h1>
                <p>Most resumes contain the same basic elements: contact info, a profile summary and sections for experience, education, skills and achievements. While our builder tool makes it easy to add or delete sections based on your industry and needs, it’s a good idea to start with a template that offers you the best chances at customization. The best layouts make your information attractive and clear, with the right balance of text and white space. Color and icons should be used depending on the best practices for your industry, and whether or not to include a photo often depends on the country where you intend to work.</p>
                <p>Our templates are expertly designed so that all your information fits on one page (strongly recommended for most industries and experience levels), without looking crammed or cluttered. Our <a href="#">resume builder</a> tool, along with our guides, will help you create the best layout that makes the most of each element.</p>

            <p> <strong>Name:</strong>  You want your name to be prominently featured without looking too gaudy. After all, this is the most important information that can stick in a hiring manager’s brain. Middle name or initial is optional.</p>
            <p><strong>Job Title:</strong> If you’re a highly specialized candidate, a job title quickly makes it clear what you do. If you’re applying for a more general role, or wouldn’t consider yourself an expert at any one thing, it’s best to leave this part off.</p>
            <p><strong>Contact Info:</strong> A recruiter should be able to reach you at your phone number or email address at any time, so make sure these are up to date. While a mailing address used to be standard on a resume, nowadays it's fine to leave it off depending on your industry and the hiring process.</p>
            <p><strong>Social Media:</strong> Oftentimes recruiters will check your social media to get a feel for both your personal image and professional presence. Start with your LinkedIn and include your Instagram, Twitter or other accounts if they are appropriate and acceptable in your field.</p>
            <p><strong>Profile Summary:</strong> Your <a href="#">summary</a> should be a well-rounded introduction to your skills, experience and education. It’s also the best place to inject some personality into your resume.</p>
            <p><strong>Employment History:</strong> This will likely make up the bulk of your resume, so make sure to write it wisely. Use this section to highlight not only the tasks you completed in previous roles, but what you accomplished. Frame your experience to show how you can add value to this new company.</p>

            <p><strong>Education:</strong> This <a href="#">education</a> section may not be as lengthy as others, but it can make or break your resume. Include GPA, expected graduation date or additional certifications and licenses as is appropriate for your field or experience level.</p>
            <p><strong>Skills:</strong> Ideally, you should include a mix of hard skills, or abilities involving physical objects or programs, and soft <a href="#">skills</a> , which are your most notable personality traits. Make sure to update this list based on the job description for each position you apply for.</p>
            <p><strong>Language:</strong> In the 21st century, foreign <a href="#">language</a> skills are so important, that they sometimes warrant their own resume section. Make sure to include your working proficiency level, either in general, or you can break it down into speaking, reading and writing.</p>
            <p><strong>References:</strong> You won’t always need to put <a href="#">references</a> on a resume, but if an employer asks, it’s best to have three professional contacts who can vouch for your abilities and conduct. Include their names, email addresses and a daytime phone number.</p>
            <p><strong>Awards and achievements:</strong> You may choose to wrap this section into your experience bullet points, but if not, you can highlight your biggest accomplishments towards the bottom of your resume.</p>
